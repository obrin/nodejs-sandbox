/**
 Functors
 - Functors are objects that have a map method. e.g., Array is a functor because it has an implementation of map
 - It is the object that is implement map that is the functor
 - The functor is responsible for unwrapping the individual values passed in and passes each of those into a function
 - The functor then takes the processed values and creates a new structure for those values to be returned
